#Description
This is a workaround to make work the CSS animations coming with visual composer plugin together with the fullpagejs plugin [fullpage for visual composer]("http://codecanyon.net/item/fullpage-for-visual-composer/13112364").

##Installation
You have to put this code under the "afterLoad" event that you can find in the Events section of the plugin (see the image below).

##Script
[View script.js]("https://github.com/AndreaMorone/animations-for-fullpagejs-and-visual-composer/blob/master/script.js")

#Disclaimer
The code has been tested on a system with just visual composer and fullpagejs plugins. Maybe other plugins or particular themes may render ineffective the script. Use it at your own risk.
